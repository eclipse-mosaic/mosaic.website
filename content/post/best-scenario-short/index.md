title: Introducing the BeST Scenario
categories:
  - Simulation
summary: We present a large-scale traffic scenario of Berlin for the Evaluation of Smart Mobility Applications. This scenario provides 24 hours of motorized private traffic, including almost 2,25 million individual trips. The Berlin SUMO Traffic (BeST) scenario is open-source and prepared to be compatible with Eclipse MOSAIC.

**We present a large-scale traffic scenario of Berlin for the Evaluation of Smart Mobility Applications. This scenario provides 24 hours of motorized private traffic, including almost 2,25 million individual trips. The Berlin SUMO Traffic (BeST) scenario is open-source and prepared to be compatible with Eclipse MOSAIC.**

During the last two years, we spend much time on preparing this scenario for our own purposes. 
We now want to share the result with researchers worldwide to enable assessment of smart mobility applications on a large scale.
For that purpose, we offer a MOSAIC compatible simulation scenario which contains configuration files for a traffic scenario for Eclipse SUMO.
This scenario covers motorized private traffic for 24 hours in the area of Berlin.
With MOSAIC, vehicles can be equipped with any kind of application, including simulation of communication among vehicles or server applications to model ITS.

We presented the scenario on [CSUM 2022](https://csum.civ.uth.gr/) (taking place 31 August - 2 September 2022) and also prepared a paper presenting our methodology on creating the scenario.
The paper will be published soon in the conference proceedings via Springer Link.

Meanwhile, you can already use the scenario which is available on GitHub: [ <i class="fab fa-github"></i> https://github.com/mosaic-addons/best-scenario](https://github.com/mosaic-addons/best-scenario)
