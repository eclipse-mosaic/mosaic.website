### Changelog

```shell
[A+] Perception module is now working with viewing angles larger than 180 degrees.
[A+] Introducing perception modifiers, such as occlusion or simple error models.
[A+] Improved API of vehicle operating system; action methods (e.g., change speed) now accept nanoseconds.
[M+] Improved handling of priorities when processing time advance requests.
[M+] Allow parallel execution of federates based on same Docker image (e.g., when running simulations in parallel).
[M+] Added configuration option to configure decimal separator in file output generator.
[C+] Upgraded ns-3 federate to support ns3-36.1.
[C+] Improved default logging of OMNeT++ and ns-3 simulations to be less verbose.
[C-] Fixed a bug in OMneT++ federate using the wrong `omnetpp.ini`.
[S+] Added import of building information from OSM, e.g., for wall occlusion in perception module. 
[T+] Improved coupling of traffic simulator SUMO with vehicle simulators (e.g., PHABMACS or Carla).
[T+] Now supports SUMO 1.14.1
[T+] Released Berlin SUMO Traffic (BeST) scenario at https://github.com/mosaic-addons/best-scenario
