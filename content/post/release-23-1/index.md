### Changelog

```shell
[M+] MOSAIC now requires at least Java 11 Runtime Environment to be executed.
[M+] Improved MOSAIC Tutorials on eclipse.dev/mosaic and related applications.
[A+] Perception Module leaves experimental phase and is now available per default.
[A+] New perception modifiers model occlusion based on bounding boxes, and errors on heading and dimension of perceived objects.
[A+] The application API was extended to get access to the unit's logging directory (e.g. for data export).
[M+] Mapping of vehicle applications now follows a stochastic distribution per default instead of a repeating pattern (configurable).
[M-] Fixed that vehicle deceleration values were omitted in specific configuration setups.
[S+] Import of SUMO net files in Scenario-Convert supports almost any projection now (only UTM was supported). 
[S-] Fixed database type affinities to make scenario-database more robust.
[T+] Vehicles defined in integrated SUMO scenarios can now be mapped with complex application distributions.
[T+] Now supports SUMO 1.18.0
[X+] Path handling in Simulation-Runner is more robust now.
```
