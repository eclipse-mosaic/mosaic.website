### Migration Guide  

With the improved integration of SUMO scenarios it is now possible to create a MOSAIC scenario based on any
existing SUMO scenario (`*.sumocfg`, `*.net.xml`, and `*.rou.xml`). To achieve, we had to adjust our 
road network model in a way that it matches better the network representation of SUMO. 

**This adjustment, however, affects all existing MOSAIC scenarios.**

The following steps should be followed if you want to migrate your already existing MOSAIC scenario to the latest version:

1. Download the newest version of [scenario-convert](https://www.dcaiti.tu-berlin.de/research/simulation/download).
2. Run `scenario-convert --update -d path/to/database.db` to update the database file of your scenario.
3. Run `scenario-convert --db2sumo -d path/to/database.db` to generate a new SUMO network.
4. Move the generated `*.net.xml` file to the `sumo` directory of your scenario and replace the existing one with it.
