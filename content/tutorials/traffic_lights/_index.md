In this brief tutorial we will discuss how to interact with traffic lights via Eclipse MOSAIC. Usually the position and 
the lanes they control are coming from the OpenStreetmap-data, which we will also assume during this tutorial.Note that
this tutorial is intended to be used with the [Tiergarten scenario](/tutorials/tiergarten),
so creating a new scenario for is not necessary here and the Traffic Light data is already exported.

At first, we cover the general steps necessary to enable traffic lights and eventually “map” applications onto them. Each
step is described in more detail later on.

After completing this tutorial you will be able to:
- Tell `scenario-convert` to export the traffic light information into the database
- Determine the node ids of the traffic lights which should have applications on them
- Adjust the mapping configuration of Eclipse MOSAIC accordingly and assign the desired application(s) onto one or more
traffic lights.

Additional information on how to use traffic lights, how they are modeled within sumo and how their phases work can be
found in the sumo wiki under [Sumo/Traffic Lights](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/Traffic_Lights.html).

## Use scenario-convert to export traffic lights

Although the Tiergarten scenario which we are focusing on in this tutorial already has the traffic lights exported from 
the .osm file, this step is important if you desire to set up an own scenario.
For the Tiergarten example, the scenario-convert command line looks like this:

```windows
scenario-convert.jar --osm2sumo -d tiergarten .db -i tiergarten.osm -l -n
```
_Export of traffic lights using scenario-convert_

Note the `-l` switch here that actually exports the traffic light information from the .osm file to the tiergarten.db database.
If this command line switch is omitted the traffic lights will not be available in the scenario.
More information on how traffic lights are handled by Open Streetmap can be found in their wiki
[OpenStreetMap/Traffic Signals](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dtraffic_signals).

## Determine the traffic lights that should be equipped with applications

The next step is to decide which traffic lights should have applications on them. Since their ID(s) have to be referenced
in the mapping, we will have to determine them first. There are several ways to do this, e.g. taking them directly from 
the database using a tool like `sqlitebrowser` or extract them directly with a text editor from the `.net.xml` file that 
gets generated by scenario-convert for usage with sumo. However, here we will focus on a graphical approach using
`sumo-gui` since it is the easiest way to determine the exact traffic lights we want to map applications too.

{{< figure src="images/tlSumoGui.png" title="Locating traffic lights in sumo gui" numbered="true" >}}

The figure above shows how to locate a specific traffic light, or more precise, a traffic light group. The process is as 
simple as scrolling to the desired traffic light, right click on it and write down the number behind tlLogic in the drop 
down menu or use the `copy to clipboard` feature of the sumo gui. This id is then used in the next section which explains 
how to actually map applications to a traffic light.

## Configure the mapping for traffic lights

{{% alert tip %}}
Read the detailed documentation of the [Mapping Configuration](/docs/mosaic_configuration/mapping_ambassador_config).

Now that we have the ids of the traffic lights we can modify the mapping to assign application(s) to them. Note that the 
tutorial scenario already has applications assigned to two arbitrary traffic lights, so the mapping file bundled with it 
can also be used as a starting point here. In general, the mapping looks the same as for vehicles or RSUs. First, we 
define a prototype that is used for all subsequent traffic lights:

```json
{
	"prototypes": [
		{
			"applications": [ "org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.trafficlight.TrafficLightControlApp" ],
			"name": "TrafficLight"
		}
	]
}
```

The following listing shows an additional prototype called `TrafficLight` that gets associated
with the `TrafficLightExample` application. Note that the application that should run on the traffic light has to extend
`AbstractApplication<TrafficLightOperatingSystem>` in order to work. The next step is to use this prototype and assign
it to a traffic light we found in the section before using the sumo gui:

```json
"trafficLights": [
	{
		"tlGroupId": "27011311",
		"name": "TrafficLight"
	},
	{
		"tlGroupId": "252864801",
		"name": "TrafficLight"
	}
]
```

The listing above shows as an example how this prototype is assigned via the `name` attribute to specific traffic lights.
The important aspect here is that `tlGroupId` refers to the id of the traffic light we found via the sumo gui in section
which must exactly match each other.

## The Traffic Light API

In order to access the traffic light functionality from within an application it must extend the
`AbstractApplication<TrafficLightOperatingSystem>` abstract class. There are two main functionalities provided by it,
reachable from the application operating system that can be acquired by using the `getOperatingSystem()` method:

* Change the currently active traffic light program via `setProgramById()`
* Adjust the remaining time of the currently active phase via `setPhaseRemainingDuration()`

However, adding a new traffic light program from within the application at runtime using the Eclipse MOSAIC application 
interface is currently not possible and has to be done beforehand via sumo as described
[here](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation/Traffic_Lights). The two main ways of doing this is to use an `additional-file`
or the `tls_csv2SUMO.py` tool bundled with sumo. However, it is possible to add a new program by using the TraCI
interface as described [here](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI/Change_Traffic_Lights_State).
