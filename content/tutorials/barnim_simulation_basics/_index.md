## Overview

In this scenario, several cars drive on the blue route and are forced to slow down in a specific section due
to icy conditions. The rest of the scenario can be described as follows:

1. The scenario consists of three types of vehicles, all of which are mapped with the `SlowDownApp`. One group is additionally equipped with the `WeatherWarningApp`, the other is instead equipped with the `WeatherWarningAppCell`, and the third is only equipped with the  `SlowDownApp`.
2. The road on the vehicle's path has an environmental hazard (icy section) on it. The `SlowDownApp` induces a slowdown for vehicles that encounter the icy road.
3. The vehicles with the `WeatherWarningApp` are equipped with ad-hoc (WiFi) communication. When they encounter the icy road, they create a **GeoCircle** with a radius of 3km and the center in their own position. A **DENM** (decentralized environmental notification message) is sent out and cast onto the GeoCircle. Because the ad-hoc communication range is usually only about 500m, the area is being **flooded** with the message, meaning the message is being forwarded to all vehicles that can receive it in the GeoCircle.
4. If the density of vehicles with ad-hoc communication is too low, then not all vehicles that are equipped with ad-hoc communication inside the GeoCircle will be warned.
6. The  `WeatherWarningAppCell` functions the same but uses the cell network for communication instead. Allowing for a higher effective communication range. Furthermore, this removes the need for a certain density of vehicles equipped with cellular communication to reach all vehicles in the GeoCircle.
7. Upon receiving a DENM, vehicles with a weather warning app will recalculate their route. Transmitted over the DENM is the information about the slowdown induced by the icy road, which factors into route recalculation. The new route is shown in Figure 1 in green.
8. There is a **WeatherServer** that propagates weather information over the cellular network. Allowing the vehicles equipped with cellular communication to be warned even before one of them detects the icy road. The `WeatherWarningAppCell` therefore receives messages from other vehicles **and** the WeatherServer.
9. In summary, while the simulation is running, you should see with the [Websocket Visualizer](/docs/visualization), vehicles as moving markers indicating when they are sending **V2X** messages (green vehicles) and receiving **V2X** messages (red vehicles).

More information about the [Simple Network Simulator](/docs/simulators/network_simulator_sns) and the [Network Simulator Cell](/docs/simulators/network_simulator_cell) can be found in the documentation.

## Overview of Applications 

In this section, the applications used in the Barnim tutorial will be described briefly. 

| Application | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.`**`SlowDownApp`** | Induces a speed reduction as soon as the onboard sensors detect hazardous conditions. After leaving the hazardous area, the vehicles will resume by increasing their speed again.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.`**`WeatherWarningApp`** | Enables ad hoc communication for equipped units/vehicles. Vehicles that have detected a hazardous condition will send out a signal via ad-hoc communication. Vehicles with the same app that receive such a signal will reroute if practical. They might not be able to receive DENMs due to range limitations and drive into the icy section nonetheless. |
| `org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.`**`WeatherWarningAppCell`** | A specialized form of the weather warning application above that can make use of cellular communication. Also allows equipped vehicle to communicate with the WeatherServer.                                                                                                                        |
| `org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.`**`WeatherServerApp`** | Simulates a Weather-Server equipped with cellular communication. It is able to warn vehicles that can make use of cellular communication.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Mapping configuration

This section gives a short explanation of the mapping we use in this scenario. 
First, we use five different types of entities. 
One server, namely the WeatherServer, and four types of cars, each of them loaded with different applications. 
As usual, the configuration takes place in `mapping/mapping_config.json` in your scenario folder.

In this tutorial, there is only one vehicle type named `Car` configured in the `prototypes` section. 
The `prototypes` attributes allows you to specify the properties and behaviour of all vehicles 
which inherit this vehicle type.

{{% alert tip %}}
Read the detailed documentation of the [Mapping Configuration](/docs/mosaic_configuration/mapping_ambassador_config).  
{{% /alert %}}

```json
"prototypes": [
    {
        "name": "Car",
        "vehicleClass": "ElectricVehicle",
        "accel": 2.6,
        "decel": 4.5,
        "emergencyDecel": 6.0,
        "length": 5.00,
        "maxSpeed": 70.0,
        "minGap": 2.5,
        "sigma": 0.5,
        "tau": 1,
        "speedFactor": 1.0,
        "speedMode": "DEFAULT",
        "laneChangeMode": "DEFAULT",
        "deviations": {
            "speedFactor": 0.0,
            "length": 0.0,
            "minGap": 0.0,
            "maxSpeed": 0.0,
            "accel": 0.0,
            "decel": 0.0,
            "tau": 0.0
        }
    }
]
```

The `WeatherServer` is configured in 
the `servers` section of the `mapping_config.json` file. 
For the `CellAmbassador` to be able to recognize the `WeatherServer`, the `group`-field in the mapping below is 
`WeatherServer`. 
For a correct recognition, this field matches the `id`-field in the `cell/network.json`.
Check out [server configuration](https://www.eclipse.org/mosaic/docs/simulators/network_simulator_cell/#server-configuration) for more info.

```json
"servers": [
        {
            "name": "WeatherServer",
            "group": "WeatherServer",
            "applications": [ "org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.WeatherServerApp" ]
        }
]
```
In the `vehicles` section, we define the actual vehicles driving in the simulation. Each item represents 
a flow of vehicles on a certain route, which can be configured the following:
* `startingTime`: Start time of the first vehicle.
* `targetFlow` : Time distance between two departing vehicles, given in vehicles per hour (1800 veh/h = 2 sec time distance). 
* `maxNumberVehicles`: Maximum number of vehicles to be spawned in that particular flow.
* `route`: The initial route, the vehicles use when they are spawned.
* `types`: Mapping of the application and vehicle type. A weighting factor controls the mapping probability for each type.

The `types` attribute defines the vehicle type and the applications mapped to the vehicle. By having
the `weight` attribute, we define a distribution of vehicle types. In this case, 10% of the vehicles
using cellular based application, 20% using ITS-G5 based application, and 70% of the vehicles
have no additional functionality to receive messages from the weather server.

```json
"vehicles": [
        {
            "startingTime": "5.0 s",
            "targetFlow": 1800,
            "maxNumberVehicles": 120,
            "route": "1",
            "lanes": [ 0, 1 ],
            "types": [
                {
                    "applications": [
                        "org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.WeatherWarningAppCell",
                        "org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.SlowDownApp"
                    ],
                    "name": "Car",
                    "group": "Cellular",
                    "weight": 0.1
                },
                {
                    "applications": [
                        "org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.WeatherWarningApp",
                        "org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.SlowDownApp"
                    ],
                    "name": "Car",
                    "group": "AdHoc",
                    "weight": 0.2
                },
                {
                    "applications": [
                        "org.eclipse.mosaic.app.tutorial.SlowDownApp"
                    ],
                    "name": "Car",
                    "group": "Unequipped",
                    "weight": 0.7
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```

## Scenario configuration

The main Eclipse MOSAIC scenario configuration file that resides in `scenario_config.json`, defines the general 
simulation parameter as (`duration`, `id` etc.). Since several applications are mapped, we need to make sure that 
the corresponding simulators are enabled. The last part of the `scenario_config.json` configuration file 
is used to enable and disable certain simulators according to the needs of the user.

Per default, the simulation of cellular communication is disabled. In order to enable communication via 
cellular networks in this scenario, you need to enable the `cell` simulator by setting the field `active` to `true`:

```json
"federates": {
    "cell": true,
    ...
}
```

The `scenario_config.json` configuration file of the Barnim tutorial should have following activated simulators:

```json
{
    ...,
    "federates": {
        "cell": true,
        "omnetpp": false,
        "ns-3": false,
        "sns": true,
        "sumo": true,
        "application": true,
        "environment": true,
        "output": true
    }
}
```

More information about the scenario configuration can be found [here](/docs/scenarios#main-configuration).

## How the running scenario should look like

{{< figure src="images/barnim-final.jpg" title="The running scenario" numbered="true" >}}
When the scenario is running, it should look as presented in the Figure above. Some vehicles are able to take a different route as they are receiving warning messages from other vehicles.

{{% alert tip %}}
If the scenario is running too fast and you can not observe vehicle markers in the visualization, you can slow down the simulation using the realtime brake `-b`&nbsp;/&nbsp;`--realtime-brake`. 
For example, using `-b 5` would slow down to 5 times realtime, that is 5 seconds in simulation would require 1 second in real time.
