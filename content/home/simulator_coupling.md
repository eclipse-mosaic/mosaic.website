**The Eclipse MOSAIC Co-Simulation Framework flexibly couples simulators from different domains to create a holistic collection of simulation models for different scales. Eclipse MOSAIC improves the development and virtual testing of new Mobility Apps. Simulators can be exchanged according to the scenario and additional simulators can be coupled easily to extend Eclipse MOSAIC.**
