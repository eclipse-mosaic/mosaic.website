|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|config|[`config`](#reference-config)|Object to define additional configuration options for the mapping|No|None|None|
|prototypes|[`prototype[]`](#reference-prototype)|Array of prototypes, which can complete the definitions of other objects. This can be used to re-use certain configurations. All possible properties of objects are available. Only the ones needed will be used (for example an RSU does not have a length, so this property would be ignored).|No|None|None|
|typeDistributions|[`typeDistribution`](#reference-typedistribution)|Object to define the distribution of prototypes to reuse in vehicle spawners. A typeDistribution is referenced by it's attribute name, which can be set to any valid string.|No|None|None|
|vehicles|[`vehicle[]`](#reference-vehicle)|Array of vehicles to be spawned in the simulation. This property describes the vehicles populatingthe simulation. It is possible to create a single vehicle (maxNumberVehicles should be '1' in that case) or a streamof one or multiple vehicles. The type(s) are defined in the field types. When more than one type is defined theweights in the prototype can be used to balance them against each other.|No|None|None|
