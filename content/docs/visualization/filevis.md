The File Output Generator is a tool which gives you the opportunity to log specific Eclipse MOSAIC interaction types. For
each interaction the File Output receives, one line (or more in case of an iteration object) is added 
to a CSV output file. This allows to track the movements of vehicles or to monitor the V2X message exchange.

One example output could be the following:

```csv

## Configuring the FileOutput

* The main configuration file is located at `<mosaic-root>/scenarios/<scenarioName>/output/output_config.xml`

#### Basic configuration

The following listing shows a basic example for the configuration of the FileOutput:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<output id="fileoutput" enabled="true" update="5" loader="org.eclipse.mosaic.fed.output.generator.file.FileOutputLoader">
    <filename>output.csv</filename>
    <directory>.</directory>
    <separator>;</separator>
    <decimalSeparator>.</decimalSeparator>
    <subscriptions>
        <subscription id="...">
        ...
        </subscription>
        ...
    </subscriptions>
</output>
```
{{% alert note %}}
Note: The `<decimalSeparator>`-element is an optional parameter defining how floating-point numbers will be written.
Be careful not to use the same characters for `<separator>` and `<decimalSeparator>` as it will break the output. 
{{% /alert %}}

__Basic configuration parameters for FileOutput__

The usage of the parameters is described in the following table:

| Parameter | Usage                                                                                                              |
| ---       | ---                                                                                                                |
| `id`      | Sets the id for the output                                                                                     |
| `enabled` | If set to "false", output is not used (default value is "true")                                                |
| `update`  | Sets the update interval in seconds for the output                                                             |
| `start`   | Sets the start time in seconds for output generation. This has nothing to do with the run time of the actual simulation |
| `end`     | Sets the end time in seconds for output generation. This has nothing to do with the run time of the actual simulation   |
| `loader`  | Sets where the output is loaded from using the Java-class (see previous listing)                               |

#### Interaction record

Each interaction record is derived from a certain interaction type and composed of several entries,which are separated by Element `separator`. 
 
The configuration of the file output is explained at the example of the `VehicleUpdates` interaction:

```xml
<subscription id="VehicleUpdates" enabled="true">
    <entries>
        <entry>"UPDATE_VEHICLE"</entry>
        <entry>Time</entry>
        <entry>Updated:Name</entry>
        <entry>Updated:Speed</entry>
        <entry>Updated:Position.Latitude</entry>
        <entry>Updated:Position.Longitude</entry>
    </entries>
</subscription>
```
_Specific Configuration for interaction_

* Attribute `id` indicates the interaction type, namely the class name of the interaction.
* The element `entries` defines the format and content of the handled subscription record.
* The element `entries` is composed of several sub-elements `entry`, which correspond to columns of a subscription
record and the sequence of the columns is the same as that of sub-elements entry.

In total, there are three basic types of entries:

#### Constant

Every quoted entry is defined as a constant. The content inside the quotation will be directly written
into each corresponding interaction record.

```xml
<entry>"UPDATE_VEHICLE"</entry>
```
_An example for constant type entry_

#### Basic method

The Basic method type accesses values of the interaction object by using the appropriate `getXXX()` methods. For an entry, the
root object for method invoking is the corresponding interaction class, here `VehicleUpdates`. As this object provides
the simulation time by calling the getter method `getTime()`, the entry `Time` retrieves the requested value. 
If a null object is returned before the last method of cascaded methods is invoked, then `null` will be written
to the corresponding field.
 
```xml
<entry>Time</entry>
```
_An example for constant type entry_

#### Iteration

```xml
<entry>Updated:Id</entry>
```
_An example for method type entry with iteration_

The first part of this example is `Updated` , which means to invoke the getUpdated method of class
`VehicleUpdates`. Then a list of `VehicleInfo` objects is returned. The character `:` indicates the iteration,
which means that for each of the `VehicleInfo` objects in the returned list the `getId` method is invoked.

#### Cascading

```xml
<entry>Updated:Position.Latitude</entry>
```
_An example for method type entry with iteration and cascading_

In this example, there is a dot operation, which is a cascade operation. Here `getPosition` method of `VehicleInfo`
class is called and a `GlobalPosition` object is returned. Then we continuously invoke the `getLatitude`
method of this `GlobalPosition` object.

#### Extended Method

All the methods involved above are the basic methods. There also is some functionality, which we cannot
extract from these existing methods. So an extended method set is offered to meet these requirements
and also as an extension point in the future.

```xml
<entry>TimeInSec</entry>
```
_An example for simple extended method type entry_

With existing methods of `VehicleUpdates` and its super class `Interaction`, we cannot get the timestamp of
a interaction in seconds (only `Interaction.Time`, which returns a time in ns, is available). Here, `TimeInSec` and `TimeInMs`
are method extensions for any `Interaction` class.

#### Extended Methods for V2X Message Interactions

Interactions `V2xMessageReception` and `V2xMessageTransmission` are furthermore extended with the method `Type`, which 
provides a shortcut to the type of the sent or received `V2xMessage`. Additionally, for `V2xMessageReception` the extended method 
`Message` is available, which provides the actual `V2xMessage`. It is important to note, that `Type` and `Message` for 
`V2xMessageReception` is only available, if `V2xMessageTransmission` is configured in the list of subscribed interactions. 
If only `V2xMessageReception` interactions should be printed out, then `V2xMessageTransmission` has to be added with an empty list of fields.

```xml
<subscription id="V2xMessageTransmission"/>
<subscription id="V2xMessageReception">
    <entries>
        <entry>Time</entry>
        <entry>Type</entry>
        <entry>Message.Payload.EffectiveLength</entry>
        <entry>ReceiverName</entry>
    </entries>
</subscription>
```
_An example for printing V2X message reception events._


## Further details

The method type of entry definition supports cascaded iteration as follows:

```xml
<entry>List1:List2:Id</entry>
```
_An example for cascaded iteration_

It is possible to handle several different iterating operations, coming from the entry definition:

```xml
<entry>Senders:Id</entry>
<entry>Receivers:Id</entry>
```
_An example for multi-level iteration_

`getSenders()` and `getReceivers()` are two different iterations. In this case, a combination of both Ids from
the lists will be generated. The result may look like this:

```csv
sender1, receiver1
sender1, receiver2
sender2, receiver1
sender2, receiver2
```
_Output result of the above listing_

Note: the longest matched prefix will be considered as the same iterating operation, which means they are in the same level of iteration structure.

## Additional features

#### Limit output on time frame

You can configure the File Output Generator to write out interactions within a specific frame of simulation time.
This can be configured by setting the `start` and `end` attributes accordingly:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<output id="fileoutput" enabled="true" 
            start="300" end="1000" update="5" 
            loader="org.eclipse.mosaic.fed.output.generator.file.FileOutputLoader">
    ...
</output>
```
_An example for restricting output generation of interactions within a time frame_

#### Compress Output

The tag `<write>file+compress</write>` can be added to the output configuration, in order
to compress the output using gzip compression. This feature is suitable for large-scale scenarios with
many outputs. 


```xml
<output id="output" loader="org.eclipse.mosaic.fed.output.generator.file.FileOutputLoader">
    <write>file+compress</write>
    ...
</output>
```
