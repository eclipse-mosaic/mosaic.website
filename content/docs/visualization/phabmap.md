The 3D visualization **PHABMap** is part of **[MOSAIC Extended](/download#overview)**.

The Eclipse MOSAIC 3D Visualization Tool is based on the PHABMACS vehicle simulator and uses the same 3D
engine and models to visualize vehicle movements and various events which occur during the simulation.
Next to the road network, which can be optionally rendered by the visualizer, the following units and
events are visualized:

* Vehicle movements coming from the traffic simulation
* Road Side Units at their defined location
* V2X-messages sent via cellular communication (indicated as green circles)
* V2X-messages sent via ITS-G5 communication (indicated as blue circles)
* V2X-messages received by vehicles (indicated as red circles)
