This chapter is intended to document interactions that can be sent and received between Eclipse MOSAIC federates
in order to enable users to easily design and integrate new federates and connect them to existing
federates. Note that we use the word "interaction" whenever we describe communication between federates,
whereas we talk about a "message" primarily when concerned with V2X-communication.

 All interactions are categorized by the package they are contained in, which corresponds to their main context/purpose.
 The "Sent by" column is not necessarily complete for all interactions but should give an idea where interactions are used.

## mapping

All interactions in this package are concerned with adding/registering simulation-units to the simulation.
While most of the introductions are handled by the `Mapping`- or `Application`-ambassador, some of them
are handled by the ambassadors for the traffic simulators (see [LuST](/tutorials/lust)-scenario).
In this case the interactions are used to initialize the scenario.

| Interaction name | Description | Sent by |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `VehicleRegistration` | This interaction is sent by the vehicle mapping component to indicate the introduction of a new vehicle to the simulation. Note, this does not necessarily imply that the added vehicle is already simulated by the traffic simulator. | `Mapping`<br>`Application` |
| `ChargingStationRegistration` | This interaction indicates the introduction of a charging station to the simulation. All units are introduced at simulation start time, e.g. 0s. | `Mapping` |
| `RsuRegistration` | This interaction indicates the introduction of a roadside unit to the simulation. | `Mapping` |
| `TmcRegistration` | This interaction indicates the introduction of a traffic management center to the simulation. It holds a list of all applications and all induction loops and lane are detectors the TMC is responsible for. | `Mapping` |
| `ServerRegistration` | This interaction indicates the introduction of a server to the simulation. It holds a list of all applications. | `Mapping3` |
| `TrafficLightRegistration` | This interaction indicates the introduction of a traffic light (group) to the simulation. It holds a traffic light group, which unites all traffic light signals used for one traffic light system.  | `Mapping` |
| `TrafficSignRegistration` | This interaction indicates the introduction of a traffic sign.  | `Mapping` |


### mapping.advanced

Interactions in this package are still concerned with the mapping of vehicles but differ from simple simulation unit registration.

| Interaction name | Description | Sent by |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ScenarioTrafficLightRegistration` | This interaction contains the phases and their duration of each traffic light in the simulation. This interaction shall be generated by the traffic simulators at start up (e.g. SUMO) | `Sumo`<br>`Phabmacs` |
| `ScenarioVehicleRegistration` | This interaction is used to add vehicles to a simulation using a preconfigured scenario, which could be defined by using Sumo. | `Sumo(Scenario)` |
| `RoutelessVehicleRegistration`| This interaction is sent the vehicle mapping component to indicate the introduction of a new vehicle whose route is not yet known. This interaction is usually handled by the `Application`-ambassador, which calculates a route for the given vehicle and sends out an VehicleRegistration-interaction afterwards. | `Mapping` |

## communication

This package contains interactions regarding the setup of communication-components in simulation units and interactions concerned with the transfer of V2X-messages.

| `VehicleParametersChange` | This interaction requests to update various parameters of the vehicle or its driver. | `Application` |
| `VehicleResume` | This interaction requests the given vehicle to continue its journey after being stopped beforehand. The interaction should be handled by traffic simulators | `Application` |

| `VehicleSlowDown` | This interaction initiates the vehicle to slow down in a given interval. The request should be handled by traffic simulators. The name 'SlowDown' is inherited by Sumo and a little bit misleading, the speed can also be increased. | `Application` |
| `VehicleSpeedChange` | This interaction sets the current speed of the given vehicle. This should be handled by traffic simulators |`Application` |
| `VehicleStop` | This interaction requests the given vehicle to stop at the given road position, it should be handled by traffic simulators. | `Application` |
