In this workshop we will explore a scenario where commuters travel along Prenzlauer Allee in Berlin. As a vehicle breaks down, congestions will occur, and other vehicles will circumnavigate the place. Eventually, a maintenance car comes by, and repairs the car having the breakdown.

As part of the workshop, you will learn in detail about several key concepts:
- Map applications to vehicles
- Let vehicles respond to incidents
- Communication between vehicles and servers
- Re-routing of vehicles

The Eclipse MOSAIC workshops provide participants with an opportunity to engage in hands-on learning experiences focused on vehicle simulation and traffic management. This workshop is structured into three main exercises, each building upon the previous one to enhance understanding and practical skills.

**Task 1: Understanding Vehicle Behavior** \
In the first exercise, participants will execute a simulation scenario and observe how vehicles respond to a breakdown. They will learn how to configure vehicle behavior by mapping applications onto vehicles, and thereby improve traffic efficiency. 
The exercise introduces the concept of vehicles slowing down when encountering a breakdown and how some vehicles can reroute to avoid the affected area.

**Task 2: Exploring Communication** \
The second exercise focuses on communication between vehicles. Participants will learn how vehicles can notify an emergency server about breakdowns, allowing other vehicles to receive important information and adjust their routes accordingly. This exercise emphasizes the importance of communication in enhancing traffic flow and safety.

**Task 3: Implementing Driving Behaviour** \
Participants will create a maintenance vehicle that responds to the breakdown, navigates through traffic, and assists in the repair. 
The final exercise integrates all the knowledge gained from previous sessions, and this exercise showcases the practical application of simulation concepts in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion** \
Through these workshops, participants will gain valuable insights into vehicle behavior, communication, and traffic management. By the end of the series, they will be equipped with practical skills to create and manage complex simulation scenarios effectively, enhancing their understanding of modern traffic systems.
